        <h1>How Plastic Harms Asia’s Migratory Animals</h1>

            <h2>Plastic: Helpful to Humans, Hurtful for Animals</h2>
            <p>Plastics are popular in part because they’re accessible, sturdy, and durable. For this same reason, when they find their way into the environment, they tend to last. As plastic waste accumulates around the world, many people are concerned about the negative impacts in the long term. However, few global actions have been taken to combat plastic pollution — and actions that have been taken haven’t fully addressed the problem. 

                This report aims to understand how plastic pollution is impacting freshwater and land-based  migratory species in the Asia-Pacific region. The authors note that this area has high rates of plastic use and pollution, largely ineffective waste management, and a lack of environmental knowledge among consumers. 
                
                They focus on the Ganges and Mekong River basins, as plastics typically enter rivers before polluting the ocean or remaining in freshwater environments. As a result, though most plastic research focuses on marine environments, the authors emphasize the importance of understanding river ecosystems. The Ganges and Mekong are both major sources of marine plastic, with the former contributing 172,000 tonnes of plastic to the Indian Ocean and the latter contributing 40,000 tonnes to the South China Sea each year.
            
            </p>
            <p>Plastic size ranges from macroplastics (bigger than 2.5 centimeters) to microscopic nanoplastics (1-1,000 nanometers). Research on the impacts of plastic varies depending on factors like the size of the pollutant and the environment being studied. Furthermore, common study methods can’t account for particularly tiny pieces of plastic.

                According to the authors, most plastic enters the environment on land as macroplastics, either intentionally as litter or because of large-scale mismanagement. Common types of macroplastics are product packages and discarded fishing gear, which can be ingested by animals or cause entanglement. Plastics also cause toxic chemicals to spread into the environment, and they can lead to the spread of non-native, “invasive” organisms who dwell on their surface.
                
                Smaller forms of plastic, especially microplastics, are harder to remove from the environment. Some of these debris are designed to be small (e.g., small consumer product fragments like a medicine cap) or come about when macroplastics break down. Small plastic debris can also be ingested, and microplastics are known to cause high levels of chemical exposure.   
                
                The authors look at migratory species because they note these animals are highly vulnerable to plastic exposure (added the problem is that many migratory animals are endangered). For example, they may ingest plastic when they travel to new regions, and they may also transfer plastics to new environments. Migratory species include birds, but they can also include invertebrates, fishes, reptiles, and mammals...</p>
