            <h3 class="title"> American National Parks </h3>
            <p>One of United States’ greatest contributions to the global marketplace of ideas is the concept of national parks. Starting in 1872 with the establishment of Yellowstone National Park, our national park system has grown to over 400 units, including such iconic landscapes as Yosemite, Denali, Grand Teton, and Acadia, as well as cultural and historic sites like Gettysburg, Valley Forge, and Mesa Verde. However, just as the United States has not achieved full justice or equality for all its citizens, our national park system is a work in progress. The National Park Service “Organic Act” directs the agency to manage the parks “to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and the wild life therein and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations.” Furthermore, the agency is required to defer to protection “when there is a conflict between conserving resources and values and providing for enjoyment of them, conservation is to be predominant.”...</p>

            <h3 class="title">Another BigFoot Sighting?</h3>
            <p>The legends of Yeti and Bigfoot have been around for decades – even centuries, and I remember my early exposure to the Yeti story following the first ascent of Mt. Everest (Sagarmatha) by Tenzing Norgay and Sir Edmund Hillary on May 29, 1953. I was almost four years old then and, as a budding primatologist, completely fascinated by the possibility that such a fantastic animal might exist. Norgay and Hillary saw and photographed huge footprints crossing a snowfield in the high Himalayas (which had actually been reported earlier in a 1951 reconnaissance expedition, but it was the Mt. Everest expedition that truly brought it to the world’s attention), and it created quite an international stir. Not to be outdone, in the United States, we resurrected the ancient Northwest Native American legend of Sasquatch, baptizing it “Bigfoot” based on a plaster cast of a very large footprint taken in 1967 in Bluff Creek, in northern California. 
            Interest in these two legends has waxed and waned over my lifetime, but it has always been kept alive by what are called “cryptozoologists,” people who avidly follow the stories of the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland, the Mokele Mbembe in the Congo, and the Orang Pendek in Sumatra. I even know a Harvard-trained, world class Ph.D. ornithologist who spent a good five years of his life trying to track down the legendary Mapinguari in Brazil and neighboring Amazonian countries. These are the hard-core people who want so much to discover new and wonderful species unknown to science. And I certainly don’t want to take anything away from them because I myself have long been interested in the discovery of new species since the earliest days of my career. Indeed, I have discovered or been closely involved with the description of 21 species new to science and have eight more named after me (two lemurs from Madagascar, an Amazonian Saki monkey, three frogs, a lizard and an ant). I have closely followed some of the great discoveries of species since the beginning of the 20th century, among them...
